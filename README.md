## ☁️ Use of Linode

We utilized Linode for its hosting and storage. Linode is one of the top IaaS providers and is incredibly easy to use and the free Linode credit from MLH for us to learn and build on Linode was the cherry on the cake! Linode is fast, flexible, and reliable, and we truly enjoyed using it.
